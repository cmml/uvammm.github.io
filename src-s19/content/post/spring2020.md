This course will be offered again in Spring 2020. The content and
format of the class will evolve from what was done in the first
offering of the course, but will mostly cover similar topics and have
a similar structure.  We will post more information about the Spring
2020 class, and an updated syllabus soon, but for now, you can get a
good idea what the course will be like by looking at the materials
here from the Spring 2019 course.
