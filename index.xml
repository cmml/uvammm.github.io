      <title>Office Hours Schedule</title>
      <link>https://uvammm.github.io/officehours/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://uvammm.github.io/officehours/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The office hours schedule is now set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron Lloyd, Mondays, 6-7:30pm (Rice 442)&lt;br /&gt;
Denis Nekipelov, Tuesdays, 11am-12:30pm (Monroe 254)&lt;br /&gt;
Kyeongtak Do, Thursdays, 11am-12:30pm (Monroe Basement)&lt;br /&gt;
David Evans, Fridays, 8:30-10:00am (Rice 507)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to make an appointment for office hours - the point of
them is that you can just stop by and discuss whatever you want. If
you do want to meet with one of us but can&amp;rsquo;t make an office hours
time, best to send a message on slack to schedule another time (or for
me, you can use
&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/&#34;&gt;https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/&lt;/a&gt;
to schedule it directly).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Survey Questions Answered</title>
      <link>https://uvammm.github.io/surveyquestions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://uvammm.github.io/surveyquestions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are my (Dave) answers to questions you asked for the &lt;em&gt;What
question do you have for us?&lt;/em&gt; question on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/survey&#34;&gt;Beginning of
Semester Survey&lt;/a&gt;. If you missed your chance to ask a question
on the survey, or want to follow-up on any of these, feel free to ask
additional questions in slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
What was the reason to start this course at UVA?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
Prof. Nekipelov and I have a long-term goal of building a joint Economics/Computer Science major here, and this course is the pilot course for the major. I talked about my personal reasons for wanting to teach this course in &lt;a href=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/class1&#34;&gt;Class 1&lt;/a&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
Grading policy?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
My main grading policy is to not have a grading policy. Policies are, by nature, rigid and inflexible, and at least for college students, grades shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so stressful for you that you need a policy to be comfortable. Much better to not worry about them too much, trust your teachers to be fair, and focus on learning. I do have a grading &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, which is roughly explained &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/paradise/teaching/#grading&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
How did students from the previous semester decide what topics to focus on?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we ran the final project last year, students had about a week
to form a project team and come up with a project idea. We had some
time in class discussing project ideas and giving teams feedback on
their direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the teams came up with good ideas quickly. Others had a hard
time coming up with ideas, and we encouraged them to look for
potential projects based on their interests and things that bugged
them about their everyday lives. Some of these turned into interesting
projects, but others maybe not. (You can judge for yourself by &lt;a
href=&#34;/s19/finalreports/&#34;&gt;reading their final project reports&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;rsquo;ll try a few more concrete things to find good project
ideas this semester, including having a list of suggested papers with
data sets as starting points. You&amp;rsquo;ll also have more time for the final
projects than last year&amp;rsquo;s course, so we hope everyone will find
someting exciting and interesting to do, and be able to execute a
fulfilling project.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt; Assuming it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be directly
course related, I&amp;rsquo;m curious: What percentage of the value of a college
education would you estimate to be signaling?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good question, and in many ways, is course related (in some
ways, it is related to every one of your courses, of course, since
individual courses may have both signaling and intrinsic value). I
can&amp;rsquo;t give you a specific percentage, and I think it varies from -50%
(the value is learning, and the signal is actually harmful) to 100%
(the only value is signaling) depending on the degree and individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryan Caplan&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Case Against Education: Why the Education System
Is a Waste of Time and
Money&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
makes a very compelling case that nearly all of our current education
system is signaling (he does, thankfully, make at least a carve-out
exception for certain fields: &amp;ldquo;You obviously learn some valuable
skills in school (engineering, computer science, signaling models).&amp;rdquo;
(quoting David Autor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, of course, I hope that things students learn and
experience in college can have a big positive impact on their lives,
and have seen at least some clear cases of evidence that this can be
true. That said, a large fraction of the value of a UVA degree is from
signaling, and the high success rate (however one might define
success) of UVA students after graduation has a lot more to do with
the filtering process done by admissions and the signaling value of
the degree, than what students learn here being so much better than
what students learn at a less prestigious school with lower success
rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite Bryan Caplan book is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids:
Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You
Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which I encourage everyone to read. Probably better not to read &lt;em&gt;The
Case Against Eduction&lt;/em&gt; until you are close to graduating with a
valuable (for signaling) degree, since part of the case he makes is
that while public investment in education is bad for society and
exaccerbates inequality, for a talented individual, investment (of
time and money) in education is unquestionably a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a course level, one (depressing to teachers) sign that UVA students
value courses more for than for learning is that my experience is
similar to Caplan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;mdash; although students will complain bitterly
about not being able to enroll in a class they want, I can count on
one hand the number of students (and on the other hand the
non-students) who have regularly attended and participated in classes
I&amp;rsquo;ve taught at UVA without getting being enrolled in them (despite
there being no barriers for any student to participate in any class
they want, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled and paying
tuition for it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
I am curious about the future of ad bidding, especially for large search engines like Google, Bing etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
Me too! Luckily, Prof. Nekipelov will talk about this in several lectures (and you&#39;ll explore it in Project 4).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
Does it matter what sort of computer we plan to use for this course?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
No, other than it should be one that you are happy using and can use efficiently. The assignments will use Jupyter notebooks, which you can run on any computer with Python and a web browser, or using a cloud service.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
Are groups from the first projects the same for the rest?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
For the first two projects, we expect students to stay in the same teams. For later projects, you may be expected to mix up the teams.  Mainly, we want to make sure everyone is in a team with both Economists and Computer Scientists, and that all teams are working together well, and all individuals are contributing well to their team.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
Would this class count for both a CS and Econ elective?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
No, it can count as either, but not both. It depends on which of Econ 4730 or CS 4501 you are registered for.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
What is the likelihood of getting into the class from the waitlist and will this course be offered at another time as well?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who can figure out the bureaucracy of getting added to the
class without the professors needing to use SIS will be able to join
the class. The is the only offering of the class this year. (As noted
above, anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t disrupt other students is welcome to
participate fully in the class regardless of whether or not you are
enrolled.  Being enrolled only impacts whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ll get the
credits for the class that may be useful for signaling.)&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
What sort of skills/intuition would you imagine a student should take from this class?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
We hope everyone will gain an ability to approach problems from an
interdisciplinary perspective that combines Economics and Computer
Science. The specific skills that you&amp;rsquo;ll develop through the classes
and projects are less important than this, but we hope some of them
will be practically useful to you.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
What do you think is the most beneficial yet overlooked aspect of this course?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
Can&amp;rsquo;t say for this year yet, but last year the AKQ cookies were excellent!
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/s19/images/cookies.jpg&#34; width=60%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
If I am extremely beginner in terms of data science/econ, should I not take this class? What kind of CS practices will be involved?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re not expecting any background beyond what is listed as the
prerequisite for the course. We expect everyone to be comfortable at
least with small programs, so if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken an introductory
computing course that was enough for you to be able to read and write
small programs, you should do that first. Otherwise, you have enough
computing background for this course, and you should benefit from
working in teams with more experienced CS students.
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of econ knowledge and I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that I would have trouble understanding some of the materials.
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no expectation for the students in the CS section to have any
Economics background. We&amp;rsquo;ll try to remember this, but please do
interrupt in class with questions if we use any terms or concepts you
aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with. For the projects, our goal is that they will
require teams of students with Economics background and CS background
to work together, so you should make sure to ask the Econ students on
your team to explain things that you don&amp;rsquo;t understand (and conversely,
help explain CS things they may be unfamiliar with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;question&#34;&gt;
How can we best protect our personal data and privacy?
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class=&#34;answer&#34;&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t give it up for free to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeffersonswheel.org/google-federated-privacy-2019-the-dragon-in-the-room/&#34;&gt;companies with long track records for abusing it&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-engineering-school-student-probes-facebooks-vulnerabilities&#34;&gt;getting away with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to have a few classes in the second half of the class to talk
about more &lt;a
href=&#34;https://jeffersonswheel.org/usenix-security-symposium-2019/&#34;&gt;technical
aspects of privacy&lt;/a&gt;, and questions like how information can be
valued and incentives set up to encourage privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project 2</title>
      <link>https://uvammm.github.io/project2posted/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://uvammm.github.io/project2posted/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/project2/&#34;&gt;Project 2&lt;/a&gt; is now posted, and is due Tuesday, 4 February (9:29am).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Project 2, you will develop your model from &lt;a href=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/project1/&#34;&gt;Project 1&lt;/a&gt;, with a goal of improving the the &amp;ldquo;Zestimate&amp;rdquo; residual error using the data for 2017 in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1&#34;&gt;Kaggle Zillow prize competition&lt;/a&gt;. The Kaggle competition has been concluded, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to settle for learning, wisdom, and glory in place of Zillow&amp;rsquo;s $1.2M prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will run a competition in class on February 4 to see which model
works best on a (secret until then) testing data set. You should
follow the spirit of this project, not try to cheat (for example, see
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/21/ai_kaggle_contest_cheat/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How a Kaggle Grandmaster cheated in $25,000 AI contest with hidden
code – and was fired from dream SV
job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
- this is an extreme example of the kind of overfitting we talked
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://uvammm.github.io/class4&#34;&gt;last class&lt;/a&gt;). If you do discover a way to &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo;, you can get
&amp;ldquo;bonus points&amp;rdquo; for this, but please don&amp;rsquo;t use it in the model you
submit for the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project 2: Zesty Kaggle Challenge</title>
      <link>https://uvammm.github.io/project2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://uvammm.github.io/project2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;due&#34;&gt;
Project 2 is due &lt;b&gt;Tuesday, 4 February, 9:29am&lt;/b&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project you will work with the same team of four that you
formed for the first project (DM instructors on Slack if you would
like to switch teams announce teams in slack).  All team members
should fully understand everything you submit.  If there are parts you
understand quickly but are new to your partners, it is your
responsibility to explain them to your partners until everyone
understands.  If there are parts that your partners understand quickly
but that are new to you, it is your responsibility to insist that your
partners explain things to you until you understand them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do Project 2, we continue using Jupyter. Project 2 Notebook is available at:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project2v4.ipynb&#34;&gt;project2.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   
   jupyter notebook project2.ipynb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the
notebook in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
2. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the prediction algorithm developed by your team write Python
script that uses the model for prediction. Your script will be entered
in team competition in which we run each team&amp;rsquo;s script on (secret)
challenge data. The team with the smallest prediction error in their
algorithm will win the challenge. You create the sript by copying the
algorithm that you created in your Notebook to the template script
available at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/predictor.py&#34;&gt;predictor.py&lt;/a&gt;.
You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed script. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yellownote&#34;&gt;
Submit your Project 2 notebook by &lt;b&gt;Tuesday, 4 February, 9:29am&lt;/b&gt; by creating a slack group (click
“Direct Messages”) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: &lt;code&gt;@Dave&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Denis Nekipelov&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Cam&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Kyeongtak Do&lt;/code&gt;. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook and Python script to a
message (use the “+” at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

understand quickly but are new to your partner, it is your
responsibility to explain them to your partner until everyone
understands.  If there are parts that your partner understands quickly
but that are new to you, it is your responsibility to insist that your
partner explains things to you until you understand them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do Project 1, you will need to install &lt;a
href=&#34;https://jupyter.org/&#34;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the directions at &lt;a
href=&#34;https://jupyter.org/install.html&#34;&gt;https://jupyter.org/install.html&lt;/a&gt;. (As
in the directions there, we recommend using &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.anaconda.com/downloads&#34;&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt;, which will
also install Python and many useful Python packages. The instructions
in the project notebook assume you have installed Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Jupyter, download the Project 1 Notebook:
&lt;a
href=&#34;https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project1.ipynb&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;project1.ipynb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then download the data contained in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/kfuqovtz5lv2529/zillow-prize-1.zip?dl=0&#34;&gt;zillow-prize-1.zip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the notebook in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
1. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;yellownote&#34;&gt;
Submit your Project 1 notebook by &lt;b&gt;Tuesday, 21 January, 9:29am&lt;/b&gt; by creating a slack group (click
“Direct Messages”) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: &lt;code&gt;@Cam&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Dave&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Denis Nekipelov&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;@Kyeongtak&lt;/code&gt;. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook to a
message (use the “+” at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;course-description&#34;&gt;Course Description&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course explores connections between Computer Science and
Economics, and aims to develop students who can work in
interdisciplinary teams to use techniques from both computer science
and economics to solve important societal problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely topics include causation, statistical machine learning, natural
experiments, resource allocation, game theory, auction theory,
mechanism design, and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;assignments&#34;&gt;Assignments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main assignments for the class will be a series of team projects
where students will be grouped into teams of two to four students,
including both computer scientists and economists. The project teams
and assignments will emulate the work of real interdisciplinary teams
at leading companies. It will be the team&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to
distribute the tasks, communicate with each other and explain in the
project report what part of the project was completed by what team
member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final project, students will have an opportunity to define
their own open-ended project to answer an interesting question about
the world using methods and techniques from the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the project assignments, there will be reading
assignments and other preparation assignments for classes, and there
may be some individual problem sets or quizzes (we hope that these
will not be necessary, but will use them if it seems like they will be
helpful for improving engagement in the class, or if there are
students who are not contributing fully to team assignments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The due dates for the projects are below.  Unless specified different,
projects will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 21 January:&lt;/strong&gt; Project 1: Predictions from Data (warm-up)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 30 January:&lt;/strong&gt; Project 2: Market Predictions&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 13 February:&lt;/strong&gt; Project 3: Allocating Kidneys&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 3 March:&lt;/strong&gt; Project 4: On-Line Auctions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-project&#34;&gt;Final Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 19 March:&lt;/strong&gt; Team and General Idea&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, 29 March:&lt;/strong&gt; Project Proposal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 9 April:&lt;/strong&gt; Progress Report&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;23 or 28 April:&lt;/strong&gt; Final Presentations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 28 April:&lt;/strong&gt; Final Project Report&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evaluation&#34;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading will be based primarily on your performance on the projects,
with adjustments for outstanding contributions to the class.  For team
projects, everyone in a team will normally receive the same grade,
except in situations where there are problems or where not all team
members contribute fully to the project. All students are expected to
be present at all the project meetings and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grades will be calculated with several different weightings, where
your grade is based primarily on whichever weighting results in the
highest score. The range of possible weightings is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 1: 0-5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 2: 5-15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 3: 10-20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 4: 10-25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Project: 25-75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Contribution: 0-25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;honor&#34;&gt;Honor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe strongly in the value of a &lt;em&gt;community of trust&lt;/em&gt;, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most assignments in this course, you will be expected to work in a
team.  We expect you to be honest, fair, and respectful with your
teammates, and to contribute fully to your team to the best of your
ability.  We also expect you to notify the course staff if there are
any problems with your team, or if you have teammates that are not
behaving honorably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will always be expected to credit any collaborators and properly
cite any resources you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expectations-and-accommodations&#34;&gt;Expectations and Accommodations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with one of the instructors
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website
for information on this process and to apply for services online:

&lt;h2 id=&#34;evaluation&#34;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading will be based primarily on your performance on the projects,
with adjustments for outstanding contributions to the class.  For team
projects, everyone in a team will normally receive the same grade,
except in situations where there are problems or where not all team
members contribute fully to the project. All students are expected to
be present at all the project meetings and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grades will be calculated with several different weightings, where
your grade is based primarily on whichever weighting results in the
highest score. The range of possible weightings is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 1: 0-5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 2: 5-15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 3: 10-20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project 4: 10-25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Project: 25-75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Contribution: 0-25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;honor&#34;&gt;Honor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe strongly in the value of a &lt;em&gt;community of trust&lt;/em&gt;, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most assignments in this course, you will be expected to work in a
team.  We expect you to be honest, fair, and respectful with your
teammates, and to contribute fully to your team to the best of your
ability.  We also expect you to notify the course staff if there are
any problems with your team, or if you have teammates that are not
behaving honorably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will always be expected to credit any collaborators and properly
cite any resources you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expectations-and-accommodations&#34;&gt;Expectations and Accommodations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with one of the instructors
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website
