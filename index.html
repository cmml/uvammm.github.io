Project 2 is due <b>Tuesday, 5 February, 9:29am</b>.
   </div>

<p>For this project you will be assigned to teams of four (we will announce teams in slack). 
All team members should fully understand
everything you submit.  If there are parts you understand quickly but
are new to your partners, it is your responsibility to explain them to
your partners until everyone understands.  If there are parts that your
partners understand quickly but that are new to you, it is your
responsibility to insist that your partners explain things to you
until you understand them well.</p>

<p>To do Project 2, we continue using Jupyter. Project 2 Notebook is available at: 
<a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project2.ipynb"><code>project2.ipynb</code></a></p>

<p>Then run,</p>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook project2.ipynb
</code></pre>

<p>to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the notebook in your web browser.</p>

<p>The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
1. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment.</p>

<p><div class="yellownote">
Submit your Project 2 notebook by <b>Tuesday, 5 February, 9:29am</b> by creating a slack group (click
“Direct Messages”) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code> <code>@Joe Roessler</code> <code>@Jonas</code>. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook to a
message (use the “+” at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).</p>

<p>You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:</p>

<ol>
<li>The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammates)</li>
<li>A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
