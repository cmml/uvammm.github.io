        <p>Here are my (Dave) answers to questions you asked for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What
question do you have for us?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> question on the <a href="/survey">Beginning of
Semester Survey</a>. If you missed your chance to ask a question
on the survey, or want to follow-up on any of these, feel free to ask
additional questions in slack.</p>

<p>The way we ran the final project last year, students had about a week
to form a project team and come up with a project idea. We had some
time in class discussing project ideas and giving teams feedback on
their direction.</p>
<p>Some of the teams came up with good ideas quickly. Others had a hard
time coming up with ideas, and we encouraged them to look for
potential projects based on their interests and things that bugged
them about their everyday lives. Some of these turned into interesting
projects, but others maybe not. (You can judge for yourself by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading their final project reports<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll try a few more concrete things to find good project
ideas this semester, including having a list of suggested papers with
data sets as starting points. You&rsquo;ll also have more time for the final
projects than last year&rsquo;s course, so we hope everyone will find
someting exciting and interesting to do, and be able to execute a
fulfilling project.</p>

<p>This is a good question, and in many ways, is course related (in some
ways, it is related to every one of your courses, of course, since
individual courses may have both signaling and intrinsic value). I
can&rsquo;t give you a specific percentage, and I think it varies from -50%
(the value is learning, and the signal is actually harmful) to 100%
(the only value is signaling) depending on the degree and individual.</p>
<p>Bryan Caplan&rsquo;s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652"><em>The Case Against Education: Why the Education System
Is a Waste of Time and
Money</em></a>
makes a very compelling case that nearly all of our current education
system is signaling (he does, thankfully, make at least a carve-out
exception for certain fields: &ldquo;You obviously learn some valuable
skills in school (engineering, computer science, signaling models).&rdquo;
(quoting David Autor).</p>
<p>As a teacher, of course, I hope that things students learn and
experience in college can have a big positive impact on their lives,
and have seen at least some clear cases of evidence that this can be
true. That said, a large fraction of the value of a UVA degree is from
signaling, and the high success rate (however one might define
success) of UVA students after graduation has a lot more to do with
the filtering process done by admissions and the signaling value of
the degree, than what students learn here being so much better than
what students learn at a less prestigious school with lower success
rates.</p>
<p>My favorite Bryan Caplan book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616/"><em>Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids:
Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You
Think</em></a>,
which I encourage everyone to read. Probably better not to read <em>The
Case Against Eduction</em> until you are close to graduating with a
valuable (for signaling) degree, since part of the case he makes is
that while public investment in education is bad for society and
exaccerbates inequality, for a talented individual, investment (of
time and money) in education is unquestionably a great investment.</p>
<p>At a course level, one (depressing to teachers) sign that UVA students
value courses more for than for learning is that my experience is
similar to Caplan&rsquo;s â€” although students will complain bitterly
about not being able to enroll in a class they want, I can count on
one hand the number of students (and on the other hand the
non-students) who have regularly attended and participated in classes
I&rsquo;ve taught at UVA without getting being enrolled in them (despite
there being no barriers for any student to participate in any class
they want, regardless of whether or not they are enrolled and paying
tuition for it).</p>

<p>Everyone who can figure out the bureaucracy of getting added to the
class without the professors needing to use SIS will be able to join
the class. The is the only offering of the class this year. (As noted
above, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t disrupt other students is welcome to
participate fully in the class regardless of whether or not you are
enrolled.  Being enrolled only impacts whether or not you&rsquo;ll get the
credits for the class that may be useful for signaling.)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no expectation for the students in the CS section to have any
Economics background. We&rsquo;ll try to remember this, but please do
interrupt in class with questions if we use any terms or concepts you
aren&rsquo;t familiar with. For the projects, our goal is that they will
require teams of students with Economics background and CS background
to work together, so you should make sure to ask the Econ students on
your team to explain things that you don&rsquo;t understand (and conversely,
help explain CS things they may be unfamiliar with).</p>

<p>We plan to have a few classes in the second half of the class to talk
about more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical
aspects of privacy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and questions like how information can be
valued and incentives set up to encourage privacy.</p>
