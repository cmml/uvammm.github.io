<p>For the Final Project, it is up to you to decide what to do,
consistent with the course goals.</p>

<h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>

<p>You may work in a team of from 1 to 38 students, but we expect most
teams to be 2-4 students. If you want to work alone, you will need to
make a convincing case why you will get more from the project by
working alone than by working with others.</p>

<p>The <em>impressiveness</em> of your project should scale with at least the
square root of the number of class participants on your project
team. If you want to form a team with more than four students, you
will need to make a case that you have a project idea that benefits
from such a large team, and a management plan for making a large team
successful.  There are no other constraints on the formation of your
team, although we expect most teams will be a mix of CS and Economics
majors.</p>

<p>Regardless of the size of your team, you should have a project plan
that involves contributions from all team members. Everyone on the
team should have a clear responsibility for parts of the project, and
contribute substantially to the overall success of the project. Except
in extraordinary circumstances, all team members will receive the same
grade.</p>

<h3 id="topic">Topic</h3>

<p>For your project topic, you can work on any topic you would like that
is relevant to the course. This means it should involve aspects of
both Economics and Computer Science, with broad definitions of what
each discipline encompasses.</p>

<p>A project topic should satisfy at least three of these goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>fun</strong> (for you to do, and for others to see)</li>
<li><strong>relevant</strong> (to the class)</li>
<li><strong>technically interesting</strong></li>
<li><strong>useful</strong> (at least to your team, but hopefully to many)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide some ideas for potential projects to help you think of
a project idea, but you should not feel constrained by these
suggestions, and we hope many student teams will come up with creative
ideas that are not based on our suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

<p>There are four deliverables for the Final Project, described next.</p>

<h4 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h4>

<p>Due <strong>Thursday, 11 April (8:59pm)</strong>. Your project proposal should contain:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Title of your project: short description that clearly captures your project idea.</p></li>

<li><p>A short paragraph that describes the goal of your project.</p></li>

<li><p>A project jusfication that explains for at least three of the goals
above (fun, relevant, technically interesting, useful) how your
project satisfies them.</p></li>

<li><p>A project plan that explains the main tasks needed to successfully
complete your project and what you will actually do.</p></li>

<li><p>Resources you have found or your plan for finding them. For most
projects, this should include a list of papers relevant to your
project. For many projects, it will also include datasets and code
that you plan to use.</p></li>

<li><p>A list of your team members and their roles and responsibilities. If
your team has more than two people, this should also explain how you
plan to coordinate and manage your team.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You should submit your project proposal by sending a slack message to
a group that includes all of your team members and all of the course
staff: <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code> <code>@Joe
Roessler</code> <code>@Jonas</code>. You can submit the proposal as a
PDF file attachment to the message.</p>

<h4 id="project-team-meetings-and-progress-reports">Project Team Meetings and Progress Reports</h4>

<p>These will be scheduled individually, the week of April 15. All team
members are expected to participate in the team meeting. At the team
meeting, you will be expected to adress any questions that were raised
about your proposal, and to explain what your team has done so
far. This is also an opportunity to ask any questions you have and get
advice from the course staff.</p>

<h4 id="project-presentations">Project Presentations</h4>

<p>In class, on <strong>Tuesday, 30 April</strong> (the last day of class), each team
will have an opportunity to present your project. (Details will be
announced later.)</p>

<h4 id="project-reports">Project Reports</h4>

<p>Final project reports are due, <strong>Monday, 6 May</strong> (4:59pm).  The format
of the report will depend on your topic and how to best present it,
but we hope many teams will end up with project reports that are
interactive web sites (which could be built from Jupyter notebooks)
and include open source code and data.</p>
