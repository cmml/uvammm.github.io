<p><strong>CS 4501/ECON 4559: <em>Markets, Mechanisms, and Machines</em></strong><br />
University of Virginia, Spring 2019</p>

<p><strong>Meetings:</strong> Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30-10:45AM, MEC 213.</p>

<p><strong>Intructors:</strong> <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~dn4w/">Denis Nekipelov</a> and
<a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans">David Evans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Computer Science majors should register for the CS
4501 course, which has CS 2150 as a prerequisite. Economics majors
should register for the ECON 4559 course, which has ECON 3010 or 3110
and ECON 3720 or 4720 as a prerequisite.</p>

This is a draft syllabus, subject to change until the official syllabus is posted and distributed on the first day of class.

<p><strong>Course description:</strong></p>

<p>Many modern systems that were designed to help people ranging from
Internet search platforms to car navigation or restaurant recommendation
apps rely on learning from its user past behavior to improve future user
experience. They use these past data to make inferences regarding the
choices that users will make in the future. The building blocks of these
system include Machine Learning tools for prediction, Econometrics
techniques to identify what causes humans to make particular choices and
algorithms from Computer Science to provide fast and efficient matchings
between users and their choices. Users in these systems can interact
with each other that requires concepts from Game Theory to analyze their
behavior and be able to forecast the evolution of these systems in the
short and long run. Finally, users may care about how exactly these
systems use and exploit their personal information to make those
predictions and inferences. The analysis of user privacy combines the
concepts from Economics of Information and formal privacy concepts from
Computer Science Theory while concepts from Cryptography can be used to
design systems that are protected from privacy breaches.</p>

<p>This course will present a collection of topics from Economics and
Computer Science that constitute the building blocks of modern
user-facing electronic systems. Many examples will come from modern
digital advertising platforms that have both created huge success in
user reach and effectiveness for advertisers and, at the same time, have
generated a trail user privacy concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Course performance will be evaluated primarily based
  on performance on project assignments what will involve the analysis
  of data from real electronic platforms (for example, <a
  href="https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!&rsquo;s Webscope
  data</a>). For most assignments, students will be grouped into teams
  of two or four students, including students in both the CS and ECON
  sections of the course in each team. The project teams and
  assignments will emulate the work of real interdisciplinary teams at
  leading companies. It will be the team&rsquo;s responsibility to
  distribute the tasks, communicate with each other and explain in the
  project report what part of the project was completed by what team
  member.</p>
