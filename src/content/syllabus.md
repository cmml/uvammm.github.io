# Course Description

Many modern systems that were designed to help people ranging from
Internet search platforms to car navigation or restaurant recommendation
apps rely on learning from its user past behavior to improve future user
experience. They use these past data to make inferences regarding the
choices that users will make in the future. The building blocks of these
system include Machine Learning tools for prediction, Econometrics
techniques to identify what causes humans to make particular choices and
algorithms from Computer Science to provide fast and efficient matchings
between users and their choices. Users in these systems can interact
with each other that requires concepts from Game Theory to analyze their
behavior and be able to forecast the evolution of these systems in the
short and long run. Finally, users may care about how exactly these
systems use and exploit their personal information to make those
predictions and inferences. The analysis of user privacy combines the
concepts from Economics of Information and formal privacy concepts from
Computer Science Theory while concepts from Cryptography can be used to
design systems that are protected from privacy breaches.

This course will present a collection of topics from Economics and
Computer Science that constitute the building blocks of modern
user-facing electronic systems. Many examples will come from modern
digital advertising platforms that have both created huge success in
user reach and effectiveness for advertisers and, at the same time, have
generated a trail user privacy concerns.   


# Assignments

The main assignments for the class will be a series of projects where
students will work in small teams to analyze data from real electronic
platforms (e.g.,<a
href="https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!'s Webscope
data</a>, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow's housing market data</a>, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/data.html">data from the United States Census</a>).

For most assignments, students will be grouped into teams of two or
four students, including students in both the CS and ECON sections of
the course in each team. The project teams and assignments will
emulate the work of real interdisciplinary teams at leading
companies. It will be the team's responsibility to distribute the
tasks, communicate with each other and explain in the project report
what part of the project was completed by what team member.

For the final project, students will have an opportunity to define
their own open-ended project to answer an interesting question about
the world using methods and techniques from the class.

In addition to the project assignments, there will be reading
assignments and other preparation assignments for classes, and there
may be some individual problem sets or quizzes (we hope that these
will not be necessary, but will use them if it seems like they will be
helpful for improving engagement in the class, or if there are
students who are not contributing fully to team assignments).

## Projects

The due dates for the projects are below.  Unless specified different,
projects will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.

**Tuesday, 22 January:** Project 1: Warm-up, predictions from data  
**Tuesday, 5 February:** Project 2: Housing market predictions  
**Tuesday, 19 February:** Project 3: Stable matching  
**Thursday, 7 March:** Project 4: Game theory auctions  
**Thursday, 28 March:** Project 5  
**Thursday, 11 April:** Final Project Proposal  
**Tuesday, 30 April:** Final Project Report and Presentation

## Evaluation

Grading will be based primarily on your performance on project
assignments, with adjustments for outstanding contributions to the
class.  For team projects, everyone in a team will normally receive
the same grade, except in situations where there are problems or where
not all team members contribute fully to the project. All students are 
expected to be present at the final project proposal and final project presentation.
 
Grades will be calculated with several different weightings, where
your grade is based primarily on whichever weighting results in the
highest score. The range of possible weightings is:

- Project 1: 0-5%
- Project 2: 5-15%
- Project 3: 10-15%
- Project 4: 10-15%
- Project 5: 10-15%
- Final Project: 20-65%
- Class Contribution: 0-25% 

Spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of
worrying about your grade.

## Honor

We believe strongly in the value of a _community of trust_, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.  

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.

For most assignments in this course, you will be encouraged to discuss
ideas and work with others to develop your ideas, and often expected
to work in a team.  We expect you to be honest, fair, and respectful
with your teammates, and to contribute fully to your team to the best
of your ability.  We also expect you to notify the course staff if
there are any problems with your team, or if you have teammates that
are not behaving honorably.

You will always be expected to credit any collaborators and properly
cite any resources you use. The honor expectations for each assignment
should be clearly stated and make it unambiguous what is and is not
permitted. If it is ever unclear what is considered acceptable on an
assignment, please check with the course staff.

### Expectations and Accommodations

If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with one of the instructors
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website
for information on this process and to apply for services online:
