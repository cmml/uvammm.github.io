   <div class="due">
Due: 9:59pm, Tuesday, 18 February 2020 (note the later than normal due time!) 
   </div>

For instructions for Project 3, see the 
<a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project3/project3.ipynb">Project 3 Notebook</a>. You will also want to download:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project3/simulator.py">simulator.py</a> (Kidney exchange simulator)
<li> <a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project3/patients.csv">patients.csv</a> (provided dataset of patients that you should use for the notebook questions)
</ul>

Then run,

<pre><code>   
   jupyter notebook project3.ipynb
</code></pre>

to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the
notebook in your web browser. 


   <div class="yellownote">
Similarly to Project 2, submit your Project 3 notebook by <b>Tuesday, 18 February, 9:59pm</b> by creating a slack group (click
œôòüDirect Messagesœôòý) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code> <code>@Cam</code> <code>@Kyeongtak Do</code>. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook and Python script implementing your `match_kidneys` function for the competition problem to a
message (use the œôòü+œôòý at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).

You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:
<ol>
<li>The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammates)</li>
<li>A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
