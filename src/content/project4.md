   <div class="due">
Tuesday, 3 March, 9:29am. We will run an on-line auction in class on Tuesday, 3 March. 
   </div>

For instructions for Project 4, see the 
<a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project4/project4.ipynb">Project 4 Notebook</a>. You will also want to download:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project4/app.py">app.py</a> (provided code for running the auction server)
<li> <a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project4/auction.py">auction.py</a> (provided code for running an auction client)
</ul>

Then run,

<pre><code>   
   jupyter notebook project4.ipynb
</code></pre>

to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the
notebook in your web browser. 


   <div class="yellownote">
As with previous projects, submit your final Project 4 notebook by **Tuesday, 3 March, 9:29am** to a group slack containing you and your teammate and the four course staff: @Dave @Denis Nekipelov @Cam @Kyeongtak Do. After you submit your notebook, you will receive an API key that you will need to connect to the server for the in-class auction.

You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:

- The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammates)
- A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
