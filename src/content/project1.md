Project 1 is due <b>Tuesday, 21 January, 9:29am</b>.
   </div>

Communicate with your classmates to form teams of four. Each team
should have at least one CS major and at least one Econ major. Your
team should work together on this assignment. All team members should
fully understand everything you submit.  If there are parts you
understand quickly but are new to your partner, it is your
responsibility to explain them to your partner until everyone
understands.  If there are parts that your partner understands quickly
but that are new to you, it is your responsibility to insist that your
partner explains things to you until you understand them well.

To do Project 1, you will need to install <a
href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. Follow the directions at <a
href="https://jupyter.org/install.html">https://jupyter.org/install.html</a>. (As
in the directions there, we recommend using <a
href="https://www.anaconda.com/downloads">Anaconda</a>, which will
also install Python and many useful Python packages. The instructions
in the project notebook assume you have installed Anaconda.

Once you&rsquo;ve installed Jupyter, download the Project 1 Notebook:
<a
href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project1.ipynb"><code>project1.ipynb</code></a></p>

Then download the data contained in [zillow-prize-1.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kfuqovtz5lv2529/zillow-prize-1.zip?dl=0).
	      
Then run:

<pre><code>jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
</code></pre>

to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the notebook in your web browser.</p>

The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
1. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment.

   <div class="yellownote">
Submit your Project 1 notebook by <b>Tuesday, 21 January, 9:29am</b> by creating a slack group (click
“Direct Messages”) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: <code>@Cam</code> <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code> <code>@Kyeongtak</code>. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook to a
message (use the “+” at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).

You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:

<ol>
<li>The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammate)</li>
<li>A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
</div></li>
</ol>
