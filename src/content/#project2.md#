Project 2 is due <b>Tuesday, 4 February, 9:29am</b>.
   </div>

For this project you will work with the same team of four that you
formed for the first project (DM instructors on Slack if you would
like to switch teams announce teams in slack).  All team members
should fully understand everything you submit.  If there are parts you
understand quickly but are new to your partners, it is your
responsibility to explain them to your partners until everyone
understands.  If there are parts that your partners understand quickly
but that are new to you, it is your responsibility to insist that your
partners explain things to you until you understand them well.

To do Project 2, we continue using Jupyter. Project 2 Notebook is available at:
<a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/project2v4.ipynb">project2.ipynb</a>.

Then run,

<pre><code>   
   jupyter notebook project2.ipynb
</code></pre>

to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the
notebook in your web browser.

The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
2. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment.

	      
Using the prediction algorithm developed by your team write Python
script that uses the model for prediction. Your script will be entered
in team competition in which we run each team's script on (secret)
challenge data. The team with the smallest prediction error in their
algorithm will win the challenge. You create the sript by copying the
algorithm that you created in your Notebook to the template script
available at
<a href="https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/raw/master/projects/predictor.py">predictor.py</a>.
You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed script. </p>

   <div class="yellownote">
Submit your Project 2 notebook by <b>Tuesday, 4 February, 9:29am</b> by creating a slack group (click
œôòüDirect Messagesœôòý) containing you and your teammate and the four
course staff: <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code> <code>@Cam</code> <code>@Kyeongtak Do</code>. Submit your
project to that group chat by attaching your jupyter notebook and Python script to a
message (use the œôòü+œôòý at the left of the message entry field to attach
a file).

You should include a comment at the top of the notebook that contains:
<ol>
<li>The names and UVA email ids of the people submitting (you and your teammates)</li>
<li>A note on anyone else you collaborated with and how, and external resources you used.
</div></li>
</ol>
