The [FCC Auctions Site](https://www.fcc.gov/auctions) has lots of information on the FCC spectrum auctions. The one we looked at in class was the [1995 C Block Auction](https://www.fcc.gov/auction/5). You can see the [activity and revenue graph](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/wireless/auctions/05/charts/5_cht1.gif) and the [final results (Excel file)](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/wireless/auctions/05/charts/5markets.xls). 

There are lots of interesting articles on Spectrum Auctions. Some of the ones I found most interesting are:

- Paul Milgrom. [_Putting Auction Theory to Work: The Simultaneous Ascending Auction_](docs/milgrom.pdf). Journal of Political Economy 2000.
- Jeremy Fox and Patrick Bajari. [_Measuring the Efficiency of an FCC Spectrum Auction_](docs/fox-and-bajari.pdf). American Economic Journal: Microeconomics 2013.
- Thomas Hazlett. [_The Wireless Craze, The Unlimited Bandwidth Myth, The Spectrum Auction Faux Pas, and the Punchline to Ronald Coase’s ‘Big Joke’: An Essay on Airwave Allocation Policy_](hazlett.pdf). Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Spring 2001.
