The office hours schedule is now set:

Cameron Lloyd, Mondays, 6-7:30pm (Rice 442)  
Denis Nekipelov, Tuesdays, 11am-12:30pm (Monroe 254)  
Kyeongtak Do, Thursdays, 11am-12:30pm (Monroe Basement)  
David Evans, Fridays, 8:30-10:00am (Rice 507)

You don't need to make an appointment for office hours - the point of
them is that you can just stop by and discuss whatever you want. If
you do want to meet with one of us but can't make an office hours
time, best to send a message on slack to schedule another time (or for
me, you can use
[https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/](https://davidevans.youcanbook.me/)
to schedule it directly).
