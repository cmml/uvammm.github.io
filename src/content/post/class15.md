# In-Class Auction

Congratulations to Kiara Gan, Aaron Ho, Rashid Lasker, and Eli Lifland for winning the Project 4 Auction! 

It was a close competition with Team 6 (Anna Davis, Sally Greenberg,
Chris Puglisi, Courtney Jacobs) and Team 3 (Maxwell Patek, Nicolas
Izurrategui, Muxuan Yan, and Nate Strawser) tied for second.

We'll have some more results and analysis from the auction in class Thursday.
