Here are our answers to the questions you asked on the [Course Survey].

### Getting into the course

   <div class="question">
What can I do to get into the course? Is this course going to be taught again?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
Given the space constraints, we will at best be able to add a few more students to the class. If we are able to add students to the class, we will be inclined to favor students who have been keeping up with the class and showing that they are likely to make valuable contributions to it.
   </div>

   <div class="question"> 
You mentioned it is unlikely you can expand the class size. Can I assume any changes will occur by the first day of class? I still need to finalize my schedule.  Is this course likely to be offered again?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We hope to be able to offer the course again in Spring 2020, and
should be able to have a larger number of students next year. (But,
nothing is guaranteed about this yet.)
   </div>

   <div class="question"> 
Do you guys have hopes of getting people off of the waitlist aside from the ones that end up dropping the class? Will you be offering this class in later semesters? 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We will hopefully be able to add a few more students to the class, but we are not expecting to be able to get a bigger room - unfortunately classroom space at UVA is very limited - and the current limits are the maximum (or very close to it) we can have with the assigned room.  
   </div>

   <div class="question">
If I am still interesting in enrolling in the course, should I attend lecture even if I am not in the class. I have a free period during the class, but do not want to be present if space in the classroom is limited
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We won't kick anyone who wants to attend out of the classroom (unless
we get complaints from the fire marshall). The room is fairly small,
but everyone should feel free to come, and in the unlikely event that
there is a space problem, we'll sort out a solution.
   </div>

### Background expectations

   <div class="question">
The course syllabus mentions machine learning and econometrics, neither of which I am too familiar with. Would it be better to try to take this class after I've taken classes that have overlapping concepts?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">

   </div>

### Why we're teaching the course

   <div class="question">
What inspired you guys to teach this course? 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
We'll talk about this the first day. (And maybe add a written answer here soon).
   </div>

   <div class="question">
To what extent can computer science be used to solve problems in economics, and vice versa? Are there any limitations to how we can solve these problems?
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
At some level, all problems in science are computing problems, and all practical problems are economic ones. 

   </div>

### Grading

   <div class="question">
How is our grade broken down? 
   </div>
   <div class="answer">
The updated [syllabus](/syllabus) has a rough grade break down. But, we don't grade by a simple forumla based on weighting each assignment. We're looking for evidence to support the highest justifiable grade based on everything you've done in the class.
   </div>



How will this class be structured? I'm intrigued by the idea of exploring a different structure compared to a typical class.
Honestly, I'm really worried about a final being worth 50% of the grade. Would love to know more about what that's about and how that is going to work.
I'd like to gain experience with data analytics/practical business applications of programming -- learning the hard skills. Will this class give me an opportunity to do that, or will I mostly focus on the Econ/theory side of things? I'm not sure if the CS content will be too high-level for me to grasp and just go over my head, especially because half of the class is majoring in CS. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this.

What does it take to do well in this course? What were your motivations for co-teaching a course like this?
