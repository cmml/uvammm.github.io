## Remaining Classes

The scheduled class meetings on **Thursday, 23 April** and **Tuesday,
28 April** will be open office hours for discussions about any topic
you are interested in, including your final projects. This will be an
opportunity to get feedback or advice on any issues for your project,
including both techincal and research issues, as well as on planning
your presentation.  You are also encouraged to use these times as
opportunities to coordinate with your team and work on completing your
project. You can also you the time on April 28 to test out presenting
using zoom and experiment with different options you mnight want to
use in your project presentation.

## Final Project Submissions

Final project submissions are due **Tuesday, 28 April, 2:59pm**. For
the project submssion, you will submit a form with your project title,
team members, URL (if you have a public project site), and answer
questions about whether or not you want your presentation recorded and
shared, and if you would like to request more than 10 minutes for your
presentation.  It is not necessary to submit a formal project report
or paper if the website you submit is self-contained (e.g., if it is a
code repository, it should include a `README.md` that explains the
purpose of your project and describes your results).

## Final Projects Symposium Spectacular!

**Wednesday, 29 April, 2:00-4:30pm** we will hold a Final Projects
  Symposium Spectacular! This will be in our favorite zoom meeting
  room. Due to limitations of current [Internet
  Protocols](https://www.openhub.net/p/beeroverip), we regret that the
  symposium will be BYOB.

Each team will have up to 10 minutes to present your project (unless
you pre-arranged for additional time). Your presentation can be a
demo, slide show, puppet show, musical, video, or any other form of
presentation that you can transmit through zoom.
