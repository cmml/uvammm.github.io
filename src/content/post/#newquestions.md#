Do I need to have sufficient knowledge in coding?

Will there be TA's? How much technical support will be available if we run into snafus while coding?




How do you plan to manage CS students enrolling with an express desire to learn more about Econ -- and vice versa -- in a class that's meant to toe the line/ integrate the two subjects?


Will we work with one group for all projects? Or will our group change?
