[Project 2](/project2/) is now posted, and is due Tuesday, 4 February (9:29am).

For Project 2, you will develop your model from [Project 1](/project1/), with a goal of improving the the "Zestimate" residual error using the data for 2017 in the [Kaggle Zillow prize competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1). The Kaggle competition has been concluded, so you'll have to settle for learning, wisdom, and glory in place of Zillow's $1.2M prize.

We will run a competition in class on February 4 to see which model
works best on a (secret until then) testing data set. You should
follow the spirit of this project, not try to cheat (for example, see
[_How a Kaggle Grandmaster cheated in $25,000 AI contest with hidden
code â€“ and was fired from dream SV
job_](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/21/ai_kaggle_contest_cheat/)
- this is an extreme example of the kind of overfitting we talked
about [last class](/class4)). If you do discover a way to "cheat", you can get
"bonus points" for this, but please don't use it in the model you
submit for the competition.
