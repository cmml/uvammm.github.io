# Schedule Update

Thursday's class will be project review meetings. We will meet with
each of the teams to discuss feedback on your proposals and progress
on the projects. Weather permitting, class will meet at the picnic
tables in the Thornton hall courtyard. Please ensure that your team is
ready to discuss issues raised in the feedback we've sent on your
project, explain your progress so far, and any things you think we can
help with.
