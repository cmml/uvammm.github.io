John F. Nash Jr. (1928-2015) received the Nobel Prize in 1994 for
developing the theory of equilibria in games that was introduced in
class today. The 2002 academy award best picture movie [_A Beautiful
Mind_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/) featuring Russell Crowe
as John Nash, based on the book by Sylvia Nasar, is an only somewhat
fictionalized telling of his life story. His [Nobel Prize
autobiography](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1994/nash/biographical/)
concludes with:

> Thus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically-oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort.

> So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists. However this is not entirely a matter of joy as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person’s concept of his relation to the cosmos. For example, a non-Zoroastrian could think of Zarathustra as simply a madman who led millions of naive followers to adopt a cult of ritual fire worship. But without his “madness” Zarathustra would necessarily have been only another of the millions or billions of human individuals who have lived and then been forgotten.

> Statistically, it would seem improbable that any mathematician or scientist, at the age of 66, would be able through continued research efforts, to add much to his or her previous achievements. However I am still making the effort and it is conceivable that with the gap period of about 25 years of partially deluded thinking providing a sort of vacation my situation may be atypical. Thus I have hopes of being able to achieve something of value through my current studies or with any new ideas that come in the future.
