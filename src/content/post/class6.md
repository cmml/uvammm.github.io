This study had a smaller _N_ (2,844) (and was approved by the Stanford and NYU IRBs), but measured a much larger effect: "we show that Facebook deactivation (i) reduced online activity, including other social media, while increasing offline activities such as watching TV alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization; (iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in Facebook use after the experiment.".
