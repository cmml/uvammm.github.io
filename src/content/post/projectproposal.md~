# Project Proposals

The Project Proposals (originally scheduled to be due on Sunday, 29
March) are now due on Wednesday, 1 April (8:59pm). If you do have your
proposal ready earlier, we appreciate early submissions and will
prioritize giving feedback to proposals in (roughly) the order they
are received.

Due **Thursday, 11 April (8:59pm)**. Your project proposal should contain:

1. Title of your project: short description that clearly captures your project idea.

2. A short paragraph that describes the goal of your project.

3. A project jusfication that explains for at least three of the goals
above (fun, relevant, technically interesting, useful) how your
project satisfies them.

4. A project plan that explains the main tasks needed to successfully
complete your project and what you will actually do.

5. Resources you have found or your plan for finding them. For most
projects, this should include a list of papers relevant to your
project. For many projects, it will also include datasets and code
that you plan to use. 
 
6. A list of your team members and their roles and responsibilities. If
your team has more than two people, this should also explain how you
plan to coordinate and manage your team.

You should submit your project proposal by sending a slack message to
a group that includes all of your team members and all of the course
staff: <code>@Dave</code> <code>@Denis Nekipelov</code>
<code>@Cam</code> <code>@Kyeongtak Do</code>. (If you already have a
channel set up with all of us on it, please use that.)

You can submit the proposal as a PDF file attachment to the message.
