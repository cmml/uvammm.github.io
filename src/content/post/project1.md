To do Project 1, you will need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Follow the directions at [https://jupyter.org/install.html](https://jupyter.org/install.html). (As in the directions there, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), which will also install Python and many useful Python packages. The instructions in the project notebook assume you have installed Anaconda.

Once you've installed Jupyter, you will be able to open the Project 1 Notebook, which contains the questions and starting code for Project 1: []().

You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit your final Notebook as your assignment.
