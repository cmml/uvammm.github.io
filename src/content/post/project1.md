You and your assigned partner (see the message in slack) should work
together on this assignment. Both team members should fully understand
everything you submit.  If there are parts you understand quickly but
are new to your partner, it is your responsibility to explain them to
your partner until everyone understands.  If there are parts that your
partner understands quickly but that are new to you, it is your
responsibility to insist that your partner explains things to you
until you understand them well.

To do Project 1, you will need to install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Follow the directions at [https://jupyter.org/install.html](https://jupyter.org/install.html). (As in the directions there, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), which will also install Python and many useful Python packages. The instructions in the project notebook assume you have installed Anaconda.

Once you've installed Jupyter, download the Project 1 Notebook: [`project1.ipynb`](https://github.com/uvammm/uvammm.github.io/projects/project1.ipynb).

Then run,
````
jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
````
to get started. This will start the jupyter local server and open the notebook in your web browser. 

The notebook contains the questions and starting code for Project
1. You will do your assignment by editing this file, and will submit
your completed jupyter notebook as your assignment. (We'll provide
details on how to submit later.)
