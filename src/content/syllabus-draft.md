# Course Description

This course explores connections between Computer Science and
Economics, and aims to develop students who can work in
interdisciplinary teams to use techniques from both computer science
and economics to solve important societal problems.

Likely topics include causation, statistical machine learning, natural
experiments, resource allocation, game theory, auction theory,
mechanism design, and privacy.

# Assignments

The main assignments for the class will be two team projects. For the
first project, teams will select an interesting economics paper and
replicate or extend some part of the paper, and present the paper and
their results to the class.  For the second project, students will
have an opportunity to define their own open-ended project to answer
an interesting question about the world using methods and techniques
from the class. This could build on the paper studied for the first
project, or be on a new topic.

In addition to the project assignments, there will be reading
assignments and other preparation assignments for classes, and there
may be some individual problem sets or quizzes (we hope that these
will not be necessary, but will use them if it seems like they will be
helpful for improving engagement in the class, or if there are
students who are not contributing fully to team assignments).

The due dates for the projects are below.  Unless specified different,
projects will be due at the beginning of class on the due date.

### Project 1: Paper Replication and Presentation

**Tuesday, 21 January:** Team and paper selection  
**Tuesday, 28 January:** Write-up of plan for replication and presentation  
**11 or 13 February:** In-class presentation  
**Tuesday, 18 February:** Blog post on Project 1

### Project 2

**Thursday, 20 February:** Team and General Idea  
**Tuesday, 25 February:** Team meetings (in class)  
**Tuesday, 3 March:** Project Proposal  
**Thursday, 26 March:** Progress Report  
**Thursday, 2 April:** Progress Report  
**Thursday, 16 April:** Preliminary Report  
**23 or 28 April:** Final Presentations  
**Tuesday, 28 April:** Final Project Report  

## Evaluation

Grading will be based primarily on your performance on the projects,
with adjustments for outstanding contributions to the class.  For team
projects, everyone in a team will normally receive the same grade,
except in situations where there are problems or where not all team
members contribute fully to the project. All students are expected to
be present at all the project meetings and presentations.
 
## Honor

We believe strongly in the value of a _community of trust_, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.  

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone.  The course will be better for everyone if everyone can
assume everyone else is trustworthy, and we start from the assumption
that all students at the university deserve to be trusted.

For most assignments in this course, you will be expected to work in a
team.  We expect you to be honest, fair, and respectful with your
teammates, and to contribute fully to your team to the best of your
ability.  We also expect you to notify the course staff if there are
any problems with your team, or if you have teammates that are not
behaving honorably.

You will always be expected to credit any collaborators and properly
cite any resources you use.

### Expectations and Accommodations

If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or
requirements of this course, please meet with one of the instructors
outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with
disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access
Center to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this
course, including official accommodations. Please visit their website
